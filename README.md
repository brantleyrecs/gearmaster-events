## Starting the Project
1. Create a Firebase project and set up authentication. Use [these videos](https://vimeo.com/showcase/codetracker-firebase) as a refresher if needed.
1. Create a `.env` file at the root of the project
1. Copy/Paste the contents of the `.env.sample` file to your newly created `.env` file.
1. Copy over all of your Firebase values into the `.env` file.
1. Open the `package.json` file and change the `name` property to the name of your application, and `author` to  your name.
1. From your command line, be in the root directory and run `npm install` OR `npm i` for short.
1. Next, run `npm run prepare`. This command sets up husky to track eslint errors on commit that will make your deploy fail on Netlify.
1. To start your application, run `npm run dev`. THIS IS THE COMMAND YOU WILL USE TO RUN YOUR DEVELOPMENT SERVER FROM NOW ON.
1. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

**NOTES:** 
- If you see the following error, you did not follow all the setup steps correctly and failed to add your Firebase creds. Go back and do that NOW.
